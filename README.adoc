= Media Files Backup (MFB)

Backup your media files in an easy and fast way.

== Installation and Getting Started

=== Backup your files using the script
* Add the environment variables (con/env.conf)
* Mount the input and output end points (conf/device.conf)
* Run the script (launch_backup.sh) with the following arguments:
  - The device ID (ex: 6t, 7t, etc. See conf/device.conf)
  - The media type (IMG or VID)
----
$MFB_BIN_DIR/launch_backup.sh 6t IMG
----

=== Backup your files using the Frontend
* Start the backend (server.js - requires Node.js) in the same machine where the scripts are installed
* Start the fronted (ng serve or ng build and deploy)


=== Upcoming changes
* Better documentation
* Add a system service to launch the backup process automatically (ongoing)
